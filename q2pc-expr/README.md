Q2PC Experiment Tools
=====================

The tools in this directory were used to run the Q2PC experiments. 

- drive_q2pc_pl.sh - runs the experiment from a high level, iterating through all of the configurations and all of the parameters. 

- run_q2pc_pl.py - run each individual experiment. It connects to the machines, sets up all of the programs, runs them, and saves the results.
